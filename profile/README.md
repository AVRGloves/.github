  This organization is home to the AVRGloves open-source framework, as well as it's supporting softwares. The AVRGloves framework is a software framework focused on simplifying the implementation process of custom virtual-reality/data gloves in various virtual-reality, learning, and research environments. This organization is also home to resources that simplify the building of custom virtual-reality/data gloves based on our own designs, which are created with replicability in mind.
